# RestApiTask
This repository contains a CRUD REST API application. The application is built using `Java 17` and Spring Boot `3.3.6` and demonstrates best practices for implementing RESTful APIs with proper error handling, validation, and database integration.

## Features
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete entities.
- Pagination: Supports pagination with configurable `page` and `size` query parameters (default `page = 0` and `size = 5`).
- Validation: Input validation for request payloads.
- Error Handling: Consistent and structured error responses.
- Environment Variables: Database credentials are managed securely using environment variables.
- Technologies Used: `Java 17` | Spring Boot `3.3.6` | Hibernate/JPA | MySQL

## Setup Instructions
- Prerequisites : Java 17 | Maven | MySQL Database | Git
- Environment Variables : Set the following environment variables for database connectivity
  
  | Variable    | Description                   | Example                       |

### Example Request Body for POST `/api/categories`:
```json
{
    "categoryName": "Electronics",
    "description": "All electronic products"
}
```

### Example Request Body for POST `/api/products`:
```json
{
  "productName": "Laptop GenZ",
  "category": {
    "categoryId": 1
  },
  "price": 65999,
  "quantity": 10,
  "description": "A high-performance gaming Laptop."
}
```

### Notes:
- Replace `{id}` with the actual ID of the product or category.
- Use proper JSON format for request bodies.
- For paginated endpoints, use query parameters `page` (default: 0) and `size` (default: 5) to control pagination.
- Example: `/api/products?page=1&size=10` retrieves the second page of products with 10 items per page.
